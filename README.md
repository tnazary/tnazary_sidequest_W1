## Project/Assignment Decisions

Use this section to document key decisions that shape the direction, scope,
or outcome of the assignment. The purpose is to make your judgement and

What you include here should reflect decisions that mattered: moments
where you chose one path over another, changed direction, or adapted to
constraints.
The expected length and detail depend on the assignment
