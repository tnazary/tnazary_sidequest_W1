## SideQuest Week 1
    "The bender of all will."

## Project/Assignment Decisions
    For being my very first sidequest this assignment was more tedious than I expected. I mainly had issues with git, even though later on I found out that I did not even need it. I also noticed in the assignment description that it was said that we need to make the background (0, 0, 255) to make it red. I dont know if that was on purpose by you guys but it made it blue so I corrected it in my code.
